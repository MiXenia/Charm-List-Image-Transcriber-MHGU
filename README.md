# Charm-List-Image-Transcriber-MHGU
This program looks at screenshots of your charms and attempts to compile them into a "mycharms.txt" file that Athena's Armor Set Search can read and import. It is currently designed to work only with MHGU screenshots taken with the Switch's built-in screenshot button. So far this program is incredibly barebones and is designed to streamline the process as much as possible at the expense of some pretty standard features.

## Guide
The program is pretty straightforward but there are some things that you need to be careful about when running it to make sure you don't get stuck or cause an error.

When you launch the program, you should see this directory input first.
