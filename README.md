# Charm-List-Image-Transcriber-MHGU
This program looks at screenshots of your charms and attempts to compile them into a "mycharms.txt" file that Athena's Armor Set Search can read and import.
It is currently designed to work only with MHGU screenshots taken with the Switch's built-in screenshot button.
So far this program is incredibly barebones and is designed to streamline the process as much as possible at the expense of some pretty standard features.
